Nexus Project
Overview
The Nexus project is a machine learning-based application designed to assist users with health recommendations, covering areas such as diet, medication, symptoms, precautions, and workout routines. The application uses machine learning models to offer recommendations and supports an interactive interface to display results effectively.

Project Structure
main.py: The main script for running the application.
datasets: Contains various CSV files with data on symptoms, medication, diets, and more, essential for model training and making recommendations.
description.csv, diets.csv, medications.csv, precautions_df.csv, Symptom-severity.csv, symptoms_df.csv, Training.csv, and workout_df.csv provide data on symptoms, health precautions, dietary plans, and workout routines.
models: Houses pre-trained models and scripts used in the training phase.
svc.pkl, svc_pipeline.pkl, and svc_prob.pkl: Serialized models used for generating recommendations.
training.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook for model training, containing code and steps for preparing models.
static: Contains static assets, such as img.png, which may be used in the interface.
templates: Contains HTML templates, such as index.html, providing a web interface for interaction.
Features
Symptom-Based Recommendations: Provides recommendations based on symptoms and suggests diet, medication, and precautionary measures.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes an HTML-based web interface to interact with the model outputs and visualize recommendations.
Pre-Trained Model Usage: Pre-trained SVC models are used to generate health-related suggestions.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries as listed in requirements.txt (if available) or install libraries used in main.py and training.ipynb.
Model Training
To retrain the model, open models/training.ipynb and follow the steps to preprocess data, train, and save models. Adjust the dataset files in the datasets directory if needed.

Acknowledgments
The datasets used in this project, including dietary and medication data, were curated to support meaningful recommendations in health and wellness. The machine learning models leverage Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) for predictive accuracy.

This README provides a quick overview of how to set up and use the Nexus project. For further questions, refer to the code comments and Jupyter notebook for in-depth details on data preprocessing and model configuration.
